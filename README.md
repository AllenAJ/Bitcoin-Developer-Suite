Bitstack is a Developer Suite for Bitcoin Developers in the Bitcoin & Fractal Ecosystem.

Bitcoin developers face significant challenges when building dapps due to the lack of accessible, adaptable tooling similar to whatâ€™s available for networks like Ethereum and Solana.

So, we came up with an NPM package...

Our developer suite is a two-part NPM package for Bitcoin dapp development.
